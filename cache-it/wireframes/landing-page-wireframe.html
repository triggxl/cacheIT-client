    <h1>Cache-IT</h1>
    <p>CacheIT is an application designed to log the errors you come across as a developer.<br />
      That way you are able to reference them in a purposeful and organized manner. <br />This helps us to better
      understand the issues we run into and solve them more efficiently. <br />Being able to see the steps you took to
      solve the issue at hand makes it easier to reference the next time it arises. <br />Plan on being able to share
      your Cache's in the next release! Enjoy the app. And happy coding!</p>
